- **Design-to-Prompt Workflow**: Automatic design file detection and 2-agent analysis
- **Multi-Modal Input**: Text, voice (macOS), and image upload support
- **Interactive AI Loop**: AI waits for your feedback instead of ending prematurely
- **Advanced Project Analysis**: Technical + Marketing insights for comprehensive development

### 🛠️ Core Framework Features

- **Smart Cursor Configuration**: Optimized `.cursorrc` with auto-applying rules
- **Backup System**: Automatic file protection before major changes
- **Instruction Workflow**: Structured development with phase-based approach
- **Project Identity**: Prevents project confusion and maintains context
- **Memory Bank**: Persistent AI memory across sessions

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Setup Base Project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/Base-AI-Project.git
cd Base-AI-Project
```

### 2. Install Appdexer (One-Click Setup)

```bash
# Automated setup for macOS (fully tested)
./scripts/setup-appdexer.sh

# Quick start server (if needed)
./scripts/start-appdexer.sh

# Manual steps after script:
# 1. Restart Cursor completely
# 2. Test with Cmd+Shift+A
```

### 3. Verify Installation

```bash
# Test MCP server
ps aux | grep appdexer

# Test speech capability (macOS)
sox --version

# Check configuration
cat ~/.cursor/mcp.json
```

## 🎮 How to Use Appdexer

### Automatic Activation

1. Give Cursor any complex task (counts as 1 request)
2. AI completes primary work using available tool calls
3. **Appdexer popup automatically appears** for feedback
4. Continue refining via text, voice, or image uploads
5. Type `TASK_COMPLETE` when satisfied

### Manual Activation

- Press `Cmd+Shift+A` for popup
- Ask AI: _"Use the appdexer_chat tool to get my feedback"_

### Design Analysis

- Ask AI: _"Use appdexer_design_analysis to analyze design files"_
- Automatic detection of design files in `design/` folder
- 2-agent analysis: Technical + Marketing perspectives

### Multi-Modal Capabilities

- **Text**: Type specific feedback and refinements
- **Voice** (macOS): Click mic → speak naturally → automatic transcription
- **Images**: Upload screenshots, mockups, architecture diagrams

## 💡 Usage Examples

### Example 1: Code Development with Review Cycles

```
You: "Create an authentication module with JWT tokens"

AI: [Creates module with 8 tool calls]
    [Opens Appdexer popup automatically]

You: [In popup] "Add input validation and error handling"

AI: [Adds validation with 4 more tool calls]
    [Opens popup again]

You: [Upload screenshot] "The error messages should look like this mockup"

AI: [Updates UI with 3 more tool calls]
    [Opens popup again]

You: "Add comprehensive tests and update documentation"

AI: [Adds tests and docs with 6 more tool calls]
    [Opens popup again]

You: "TASK_COMPLETE"

Result: 1 request = 21 tool calls + 4 review cycles
Instead of: 4 separate requests = 14 tool calls total
```

### Example 2: Multi-Modal Architecture Review

```
You: "Design a microservices architecture for our e-commerce platform"

AI: [Creates initial architecture with documentation]
    [Opens Appdexer popup]

You: [Upload architecture diagram] "Integrate with this existing system"

AI: [Modifies design based on visual context]
    [Opens popup again]

You: [Voice] "Add Redis for caching and consider load balancing"

AI: [Updates architecture and documentation]
    [Opens popup again]

You: "Document the decision rationale in Decisions.md"

AI: [Updates project documentation]

You: "TASK_COMPLETE"
```

```

## 🎯 Performance Benefits

### Request Efficiency Comparison

```
Traditional Workflow:
├── Request 1: "Create feature" (5 tool calls)
├── Request 2: "Add tests" (3 tool calls)
├── Request 3: "Fix bugs" (4 tool calls)
└── Request 4: "Update docs" (2 tool calls)
Total: 4 requests, 14 tool calls

Appdexer Workflow:
└── Request 1: "Create feature"
    ├── Primary work (8 tool calls)
    ├── Review 1: Add tests (4 tool calls)
    ├── Review 2: Fix bugs (5 tool calls)
    ├── Review 3: Update docs (4 tool calls)
    └── Review 4: TASK_COMPLETE
Total: 1 request, 21 tool calls
```

### Typical Efficiency Gains

- **Simple tasks**: 2x efficiency improvement
- **Medium complexity**: 3-4x efficiency improvement
- **Complex workflows**: 5x+ efficiency improvement

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting
