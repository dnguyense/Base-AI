description: Best practices for Android app architecture and project structure
globs: **/*.{kt,java,xml}

- Use Clean Architecture or MVVM for projects
- Separate layers: presentation, domain, data
- Organize code by feature-first or layer-first
- Use modularization for large projects (feature-based modules)
- Implement dependency injection with Hilt or Koin
- Decouple dependencies between modules using interfaces
- Create contracts for interfaces between layers
- Use shared ViewModels for related fragments
- Adhere to the single responsibility principle for each class
- Avoid overly complex activities/fragments, move logic outside
